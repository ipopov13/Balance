# Comma separated list of terrain names as defined in terrains.ini. These

terrains =
# Code specifying how many special, additional and basic terrains the main
# theme level provides to the area. The default is 0 special, 0 additional
# and 2 basic, but you can freely change this. Just be sure that there are
# terrains from the specified types available in the lists of matching
# entries. The specified number of Terrains are drawn from the list at
# random with replacement, e.g. if the list only has the grass basic terrain,
# but there are 3 basic terrains in the distribution, then grass will be
# drawn 3 times. The max value is 999, the min 001.
distribution = 
# Fraction of scene terrains that should be replaced with ones picked form
# the list. This is used for modifier themes.
fraction = 

# Entry names must begin with the major theme for the group + ':', and must be
# unique. All other themes can be referenced directly with their names to
# specify ranges. The specified ranges of major/modifier theme values
# describe all areas in which the listed terrains can be found.
# NOTE: Terrain lists are cumulative, meaning that if more than one entry
# matches the theme values of an area the lists are combined to get a final
# list from which to draw terrains for the specified major theme.
# However, terrain distributions are not cumulative. Entries are scanned for
# each major theme and only the highest available distribution of
# special/additional/basic from the matching entries is used to draw
# terrains from the combined lists. For this purpose you can look at
# distributions as numbers: 123 < 024 < 002.
