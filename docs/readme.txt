| 1. WHAT IS THIS GAME ABOUT?|
==============================

I find this the most important question to be answered before playing a game. Here the
answer is this: this game is about interaction. You appear in a world where everything
is a part of the balance of three forces - Nature, Chaos, and Order. It is a partly
classical view of a Tolkien world, with elves in the woods and orks in the wastes, and
humans and industrious dwarves building their cities in-between. But there is one
difference - everything changes. And the most flowing and changeable thing is the
player's character. You select a starting race of your preference, but you are free to
do whatever you like, and your actions will eventually shape you into something you wanted
to be (if you paid attention to the effect of your actions), or just something you deserve
to be (if you didn't). Every spot in the world belongs to one of the forces, and your
every action will influence the world and your character alike. You may find a desert and
turn it into a forest, you may find a small town and burn it to the ground, you may find
a bog and divert the waters to create a farmland: it's all up to you and your determination.
This game has no graphics, and it has no ending. You play as long as you want to change
the world, and when you are satisfied, you may try playing another character, with different
goals.

1.1. Characters of the game, attributes
---------------------------------------

All the races in the game have their own behaviour and agenda, formed by the actions that
would build a character into a member of that race. If you want to play as a particular
race it is important to know what you can and cannot do, unless you unwittingly find
yourself into the skinn of something else. Before I get to the description of all the races
I want to stress one thing:

THERE IS NO PERMANENT DEATH IN THIS GAME.

I take every game as a path that the player chooses to walk. Sometimes loosing is part of
it. If you want to do it the classical way - delete your files and start over.

Every race has inbuilt skills that are unlocked at 30, 60, and 90% of attunement to that race.
All actively used (activated) skills are described in the key bindings below. Everything else
is automatic and adds to the specifics of each race (the gnome passes through stones, the elf
is deadly with a bow and arrow when in the woods, while the goblin can steal from other
creatures, etc). These abilities will be described below.

And now for the races:

ORDER
-----

Humans

I start with the most regular being that is found even on our own world - the human. Humans
live in cities, built with stone found in the world around them, farm the lands and have
domesticated animals. They wilingly trade for new and unknown things or goods from far-away
lands. They are a more or less balanced race and have their creativity to set them apart
from races from other forces - they can create a large number of items of everyday use,
including furniture and wooden weapons. The peak of their mastery lies in their ability
to study the world around them, letting them understand the motives and feelings of other
races while still being human. This gives them the ability to use skills that belong to
other races, but to do it humans have to spend a long time observing the life of such beings.

Dwarves

The small people of the earth, dwarves find pleasure in extracting it's treasures, and over
time they have become proficient in it. Dwarves can smell treasure from a mile and will easily
find places where there is some. They can work metals and precious stones, creating shiny jewels
and mighty weapons at the same time. They can build like the humans, and share their high
creativity. Dwarves are the ones that can call forward the power of Order and extract ores from
even the places where chaos has touched the world deeply and lava comes up from the earth to burn
everything in its path. It goes without saying that doing this is very dangerous...

Spirits of Order

These beings are the first of the spiritual beings of the universe, the ones that preserve
Order and keep the settlements of Order beings from the agents of Chaos. They can pass through
walls and doors and chase away Chaos by their mere presence. Only the strongest creatures of
Chaos can bring themselves to face a spirit of Order, and when they do they are greatly weakened
by it's radiating power.

NATURE & CHAOS
--------------
To be described (they are still playable).


1.2. Game features
------------------

The following are game features that you may have or have not encountered in other rogue-
like games. The main reason to read through them is to be aware of the mechanics of the game
so they don't surprise you... unpleasantly. The list will be updated along with the game.

- General

Getting tired, drowning
This has impact on movement, working on objects from the environment and combat. If you are
too tired you will stop working, won't be able to move in demanding environments like water
(and if you are too tired to move in water you will drown!) and won't be able to attack.
Natural healing occurs ONLY when you are not tired at all, so if you want to heal you'd
better sit down and rest.

Thirst and hunger
When your character is thirsty or hungry this will be indicated on the game screen, and you
better do something about it when you see it. When you are hungry you can't work or rest
properly and if you starve a lot you will die quite fast (faster from thirst than hunger).

- Combat

Combat skills
Are learned through combat. When you use a weapon for the first time the respective skill
is added to your combat skills with an initial value equal to your Dexterity or Strength.
A skill that is GREEN in the combat skills page of the character screen has reached it's
maximum value. When you increase your attributes higher levels become available.

Weapon weight
Any weapons (or anything else that you might hold in your hands, which is everything) that
weigh up to 5 stones are considered light and you use your Dexterity to determine hit chance
and defence in combat. If the weight is between 6 and 9 - it's medium weight and you use
Dexterity and Strength together for that weapon. If it's heavier it is a heavy weapon and
only Strength is considered. THIS TAKES THE SUM OF THE WEIGHTS OF THE OBJECTS IN YOUR TWO
HANDS: A 6 stones sword and a 6 stones shield make a 12 stone heavy weapon for this purpose!

Dual-weapon wielding
It is possible to use two weapons, and this gives you two swings every turn, but your chance
to hit is greatly decreased. Your Strength MUST be equal or greater than the total weight of
the two weapons. Your attributes are very important in dual-wield combat. Also, when using a
weapon in your left hand WHILE DOUBLE WIELDING, you learn the weapon slower.

Heavy armour
If you wear armour that weighs more than half your maximum allowed weight your skill in
fighting is lowered accordingly, up to the point where you lose all your skill and fight
purely on luck (when the armour is 100% of your allowed weight).

Enemies
Interesting point, isn't it? What would you possibly need to know about the enemies of your
character? Only the fact that if you have enough bad luck you can meet one that won't get
a scratch unless you have serious fighting skills or... much luck swinging your weapon.
Well, if you didn't have luck and found that cave then at least you can have luck and be
able to hit that dragon inside it... Who knows? Which gets us to

Running away
If you decide that the dragon was a bit of an overkill for you (and you are still alive)
you may try running away. This is done by trying to escape the area you are in. Success is
determined by comparing several of your attributes with those of the enemy. The more the
enemies you are trying to escape, the harder the task is. If you fail, you stay where you
are and have to endure one more round of hits to try again the next round.

- Item usage

Filling containers
When you have a container able to carry a substance like water or sand (for example a bottle)
you can fill it by standing on a place where there is a sourse of the substance and using
the container from the inventory screen. This way you can replenish your water supplies or
collect a material.

Containers in your backpack
When you pick up a pouch or some other small container you can open it by using it in your
inventory. Then you will be able to exchange items with it as if you've opened a container on
the ground

Special items (magical books and herbalism sets, lockpicks)
These items provide extra functionality when you use them:
- The herbalism set lets you collect herbs depending on your Inteligence and your herbalism
skills. Herbs are collected on many different terrains with different probability, and are
used as reagents for spells and potions.
- The magical book lets you create spells based on your Creativity and Mind attributes. Spells
will be explained later.
- Lockpicks give you the ability to open locks and use the lockpicking skill. Anyone can use
them, but the maximum level of the skill depends on Dexterity and Inteligence. Locks are picked
automatically if you have a lockpick set in your inventory.

- Magical spells (not finished)

Creating spells
You need a book of magical theory to create spells. When you have one in your inventory just
use it and you will be able to select the properties of your new spell. These are as follows:
- Spell effect - from damaging through setting on fire to healing wounds, flying, any magical
effect you can imagine. If you can imagine one that is not in the list - mail it to me and I
WILL consider it to add to the game with the proper acknowledgement here in the README.
- Spell strength - ranging from 1 to 9, the strength defines if you will light a match or set
fire to the whole forest... The greater the strength, the harder the spell to create, the more
ingredients it needs and the more experience you get by casting it.
- Target - this is usually chosen between you and something else, so there are two options -
'Self' and 'Other'.

Ingredients
When a spell is created a list of ingredients is generated to show you what you will need to
cast it. These range from common herbs to special sands and powders, monster parts, etc. The
greater the strength of the spell - the more and rarer ingredients will be needed. On the other
hand, once the spell is created and you have the needed stuff you can cast it with 100%
probability. But BEWARE: any spell can backfire on you if there was some mistake in the
creation...

Spell miss-creation
When you create the spell the game checks against your Mind attribute to see if you get the
effects, strength and target right. If you fail this you wont know till it's too late - when
your spell can fizzle uselessly (and it gets deleted automatically), turn out to be far less
potent than expected (strength is usually directly translated into damage or healing so you
will know if that has happened if you pay attention) or lands on the wrong target (like when
you cast a healing on the enemy instead of yourself). SO I RECOMMEND TESTING ANY SPELL BEFORE
USING IT IN A POTENTIALLY CRITICAL SITUATION! Furthermore, you can kill yourself off with a
higher strength spell if it backfires, so be prepared to take the damage of that 9th level
fireball you just devised.

Spells targeted at others
The longest distance at which you can cast a spell is equal to your Mind attribute.
